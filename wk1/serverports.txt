Server Ports - Week 1

1) What is the definition of server port?
A server port is a numbered communication endpoint on a computer/server that helps identify which service or application should receive incoming network traffic.
It works together with an IP address. The IP address identifies the device, and the port identifies the specific service running on that device.

2) What is server port range?
Server port numbers range from 0 to 65535.

The port ranges are commonly grouped into:
- 0–1023: Well-known ports (system/common services)
- 1024–49151: Registered ports (assigned to specific applications)
- 49152–65535: Dynamic/Private ports (temporary ports used by clients)

3) How many bits does number above represent?
The port range 0–65535 represents 16 bits, because 2^16 = 65536 possible values.
